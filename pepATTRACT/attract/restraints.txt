A restraints file consists of two sections. The sections are separated by an empty line.
Lines starting with # are always skipped

1. Selection section: <selection identifier> <number of atoms in selection> <n1> <n2> ... where <nX> is the atom number among all the numbers in the system.
Example: a receptor with 3000 atoms and a ligand with 1000 atoms:
sel 3 293 294 3008
selection "sel" consists of atoms 293 and 294 of the receptor and atom 8 of the ligand.

2. Restraints section: <selection identifier 1> <selection identifier 2> <restraint type> [parameters]

restraint types:
1: harmonic maximum distance restraint: <maximum distance> <force constant>
    force increases linearly with the violation
2: HADDOCK maximum distance restraint: <maximum distance> <force constant>
    <max violation> <chance of random removal>
    force increases linearly with the violation
    force cannot be bigger than force at max violation:
      i.e.: harmonic up to max violation, linear afterward  
      
3: harmonic minimum distance restraint: <minimum distance> <force constant>
    force increases linearly with the violation
4: harmonic distance restraint: <equilibrium distance> <force constant>
    force increases linearly with the violation
    used for bond and angle restraints in flexible interface simulations
5: double quadratic minimum distance restraint: <minimum distance> <force constant>
   used for steric repulsion in flexible interface simulations

The "chance of random removal" indicates the chance that a restraint is not used at all.
This is determined by a random number generated from a structure's seed. Therefore, the same seed with the same restraint file causes the same restraints to be enabled or disabled within every docking stage.
Orthogonality issue: the seed number is also used in pure MC mode.

Ile54_CA 1 385
Leu1001_CA 1 2356

Ile54_CA Leu1001_CA 1 2.4 2
(end of file)
Defines a harmonic restraint between atom 385 and atom 2356. The maximum distance is 2.4 A: this distance or less gives no energy penalty/force.
At 3.4 A, the atoms experience an attractive force of 2 kcal/mol / A, and the energy penalty is 1 kcal/mol
At 5.4 A, the atoms experience an attractive force of 18 kcal/mol / A, and the energy penalty is 9 kcal/mol.

Ser281 6 1064 1065 1066 1067 1068 1069

Gly31 Ser281 2 2.0 1.0 1.0 0.6
(end of file)
Defines a HADDOCK restraint between a selection of 4 atoms and a selection of 6 atoms. The maximum effective distance is 2.0 A: this distance or less gives no energy penalty/force. The effective distance is (sum(distances**-6))**-1/6. 
The restraint is harmonic between 2.0 and 3.0 A and then becomes linear (the force constant doesn't increase further beyond 3.0 A).
At 2.5 A, the atoms experience an attractive force of 1 kcal/mol / A, and the energy penalty is 0.5 kcal/mol.
At 3.0 A, the atoms experience an attractive force of 2 kcal/mol / A, and the energy penalty is 1 kcal/mol.
At 4.0 A, the atoms experience an attractive force of 2 kcal/mol / A, and the energy penalty is 3 kcal/mol.
The restraint has a 60 % chance not to be in effect at all.
