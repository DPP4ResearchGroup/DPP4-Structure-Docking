In CNS, the first parameter is epsilon and the second is sigma. These
parameters are used directly in a 12-6 LJ potential: vdw = 4*epsilon*(rr**12-rr**6),
where rr is sigma/r. This is used directly for homo-atom-type interactions.
For hetero-type interactions, the mean radius of sigma is used, while the geometric mean radius of epsilon is used (sqrt(eps1*eps2)).

In CNS, you can also directly describe the interaction parameters between two types, using the NBFIX statement. In this case, you need to supply the parameters A and B, where A = 4*epsilon*sigma**12 and B = 4*epsilon*sigma**6, so that the interaction energy can be simply expressed as A/r**12 - B/r**6.

ATTRACT

In ATTRACT, the formulas are as follows:

i, j are the atom types

r2 = distance^2
rrd = rr23 = distance^-6 (for potshape 12)

if r2 < rmin2(i,j):
  vdw = (rep-alen)*rr23+(ipon(i,j)-1)*emin(i,j)
    rep = rlen * rrd
    rlen = rc(i,j) (if weights are 1)
    alen = ac(i,j) (if weights are 1)
  vdw = ( rc(i,j)*rrd-ac(i,j) ) * rr23 + (ipon(i,j)-1) * emin(i,j)
  vdw = ( rc(i,j)*distance^-12 - ac(i,j) *distance^-6 ) + (ipon(i,j)) * emin(i,j)
else:
  vdw = (rep-alen)*rr23*ipon(i,j)
  vdw = ( rc(i,j)*distance^-12 - ac(i,j) *distance^-6 ) * ipon(i,j)

ipon(i,j) is always 1 or -1

rmin2(i,j) is computed as 4.0d0*rc(i,j)/(3.0d0*ac(i,j))
this is because r^8-r^6 = r2^4 - r2^3

if ipon is 1, then VDW is normal, regardless of whether r2 < rmin2 or not

if ipon is -1, then at r2 == rmin2, emin must be equal to (rep-alen)*rr23
  in that case: 
    rr23 = rmin2^-3  = 27*ac^3/64*rc^3
    rep = rc / rmin2 = 3/4 * ac
    rep - alen = -1/4 * ac
    (rep-alen)*rr23 = -27*ac^4/256*rc^3, correct

emin is in fact the energy minimum, and rmin2 is the distance(sq) of the minimum

so, for potshape = 12:
  rr23 = rmin2**-3
  rc * rr23 * rr23 - ac * rr23 = emin
  rc * rr23 * rr23 - ac * rr23 - emin = 0
  rr23 = ac/2*rc +/- sqrt(ac**2-4*rc*emin), not really solvable...
  So, we must kind of assume that ipon is 1!!
  
What it all means:

 The formula is rep-alen*rr23 = rc(i,j)*distance^-12 - ac(i,j) *distance^-6, no ivor
 In ATTRACT, rc(i,j) is computed as abc(i,j)*rbc(i,j)**potshape
 => rc(i,j)*distance^-12 - ac(i,j) *distance^-6
 => abc(i,j) * rbc(i,j)**12 * distance**-12  - abc(i,j) * rbc(i,j)**6 * distance**-6
 = abc(i,j)*( rr^-12 - rr^-6), where rr=distance/rbc(i,j)

so, for two atoms i and j:
   abc(i,j) = 4 * sqrt(epsilon(i)*epsilon(j))
   rbc(i,j) = (sigma(i)+sigma(j))/2
