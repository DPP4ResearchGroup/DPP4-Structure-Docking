----------
* Added support for multiple "buttons" in the category control box. This div of class catergory-controls houses buttons such as 
  "Add partners". A button element has the following HTML structure:
  
   <div class="field-container">
     <div class="field-item button align-right">
       <input type="button" value="Add partners" id="block-partners-add" onClick="cloneBlock('block-partners-',10);">
     </div>
   </div>
   
   3 of these in the category control box fits nicely. 4 is possible but does not look that nice anymore.
   
* "Reload" confirmation dialog now also shown for reload of parts of the form.
* Added tooltips for the "reload" and "remove" buttons that are part of a category.
* The unchecked state of a checkbox used to be a "x" symbol. This might be confusing with respect to the "remove" button.
  In general, checkboxes have a checkmark when checked and are empty when not checked. Because this is the most common use of
  checkboxes it is what a user might expect. This is now respected except for a change of default checked to unchecked to 
  indicate that this checkbox is unchecked.
* The default "checked" image that appears in checkboxes does not show anymore in the "switch" control for submenu's in Firefox. 
* REMARK: The File selection fields do not align with the other fields. In Chrome, they are slightly to the left. 
  In Firefox, they are so far to the left that a bit of text disappears. Since consistent alignment is not possible anyway, 
  perhaps it is safest to center them instead?
  
  I cannot reproduce this or do not know what you mean. The file selection box itself is aligned perfectly as all other input fields
  in Firefox, Safari and Chrome on my machine. The default text in a file selection box is align to the left and overflows on the 
  right side if it is to long. For me, the "to long" bit depends on the text translation. On my machine the "no file selected" message
  translates as "Geen bestand gekozen" in Chrome, "Geen bestand geselecteerd" in Firefox and Safari. In all browsers the text aligns left, 
  in Chrome the full text fits in the box, no clipping. In Firefox, the message exactly fits and in Safari it is clipped.
  When I select a file it again depends on the length of the filename if it gets clipped or not, but always aligned left.
  
  If it is the alignment of the text you are worried about I would not change anything here. Align left makes most sense to me.
  Longer filenames can be fully viewed if you hover on the filefield for a moment.
* Added a "reset form block" action to the javascript code responsible for cloning a form block. This is to reset any fields in the source
  form block that might have been changed by the user after initial load. 
* NOTE: In the "Symmetry" category, the button to add another symmetry operator lists "Add partners". Probably needs to be changed in the
  form generator code.
* Add javascript function to the "remove form block" function to renumber the remaining blocks to ensure an equal increment in ID
  starting from 0.
* REMARK: Long options in the option fields "walk off the screen", for example in "Cryo-EM scoring criterion". This is because excess 
  space for the dropdown menu (beyond the field width) is allocated on the right. Is it possible to allocate them on the left, instead?
  
  The default "select input" behaviour is hardcoded in the browser. In Safari, Firefox and Chrome the dropdown is display absolute with a 
  fixed positioning relative to the source. In all cases the long option names overflow the browser window. There is nothing you can do
  about this behaviour and it would be great if they fix this by respecting the browser window when positioning the dropdown. Ways around
  this are not using long names or position these select boxes more to the center or left of the UI.
* The UI is nativly ready to handle prefilled forms. I changed the javascript to prevend cloning of form blocks defined in the javascript
  init_clone array (now only block-partners-) if there are already more than 1 blocks available in the provided form which might be the
  case for prefilled forms. The first block will always be used as source for cloning so all values predefined will also be cloned.
